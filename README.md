# Femme Fatale

*Femme Fatale* is an antidote to the male gaze. Laura Mulvey's text *Visual Text and Narrative Cinema*, describes how historically, Woman is Image and Man is Bearer of the Look: 
>"In a world ordered by sexual imbalance, pleasure in looking has been split between active/male and passive/female. The determining male gaze projects its phantasy onto the female figure [...] In their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and displayed with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact so that they can be said to connote to-be-looked-at-ness."

Drawing from a feminist interpretation of Medusa, *Femme Fatale* seeks to reconstruct images of women that represent their complexity and powerâ€”of women who look back. 

The interactive collage uses computer vision to detect the position of the viewer's face in order to activate portraits that return the gaze.
